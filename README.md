# Data-Cleaning-in-MySQL
Layoff Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis Project in MySQL ðŸ§¹ðŸ“Š
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing layoff data using MySQL. It comprises two main phases: data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Data Cleaning Steps:  

Removing Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate entries to maintain data accuracy.

Standardizing Data: Normalized data by cleaning up fields like company names, industries, country names, and dates.

Handling Null Values: Addressed missing values by filling in relevant fields and removing records with excessive nulls.

Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Optimized the dataset by removing columns that were not needed for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analyzed key metrics, such as the total layoffs by company, industry, and country.

Conducted time-series analysis to observe layoffs trends over months and years.

Aggregated data by different fields to reveal insights into the impact on different industries, company stages, and countries.

Implemented a rolling total to view cumulative layoffs over time and identified top companies with the highest layoffs each year.

**This project highlights essential data cleaning techniques and explores valuable insights within the layoff data.**
